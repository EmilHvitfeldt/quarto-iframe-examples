## What Are Boids?
A "boid" is a single autonomous flocking agent. You can think of it like a virtual bird. The term was coined by Craig Reynolds in 1986. Boids follow simple rules, reacting to their environment and the other boids in their vicinity. Each boid's actions are fairly simple, but when you get many boids together, through the magic of emergence, many interesting and beautiful phenomenon can occur.
